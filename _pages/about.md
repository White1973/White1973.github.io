<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a master graduate student of [School of Artificial Intelligence, Optics and Electronics (iOPEN)](https://iopen.nwpu.edu.cn/en/Home.htm) at [Northwestern Polytechnic University](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Qi Wang](https://crabwq.github.io/) and [Xuelong Li](https://iopen.nwpu.edu.cn/info/1329/1171.htm) professors, collaborating with [Junyu Gao](https://gjy3035.github.io/). I received Bachelor degree at [School of Information Engineering](https://xgxy.cug.edu.cn/), [China University of Geosciences (Wuhan)](https://www.cug.edu.cn/) in 2019. My research area includes computer vision, deep learning and image/video representation learning.

I  worked on federated learning research at SenseTime by collaborating with [Weiming Zhuang](https://weiming.me/) and Shuaicheng Li. After that, I was a Reasearch Assistant at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and collaborated with Dr. [Jie Zhang](https://cugzj.github.io/zhangjie.github.io/).  Now, I'm pursuing my PhD degree at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. If you are interests in me, please send e-mail to me. Thanks a lot!
