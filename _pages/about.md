üëãüëãHi, I'm Sikai Bai. Now, I'm pursuing my Ph.D. in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering ([CSE](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/)) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ([HKUST, È¶ôÊ∏ØÁßëÊäÄÂ§ßÂ≠¶](https://hkust.edu.hk/)), supervised by Prof. [Song Guo](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~songguo/) in [PEILab](https://peilab.netlify.app/). 

Before that, I received my **Master** degree in Artificial Intelligence, Optics, and Electronics ([iOPEN](http://iopen.nwpu.edu.cn/)), Northwestern Polytechnical University ([NWPU, Ë•øÂåóÂ∑•‰∏öÂ§ßÂ≠¶](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/)), supervised by [Qi Wang](https://crabwq.github.io/) and [Xuelong Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ahUibskAAAAJ) professors. Also, I received my **Bachelor** degree at [School of Information Engineering](https://xgxy.cug.edu.cn/), [China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) ‰∏≠ÂõΩÂú∞Ë¥®Â§ßÂ≠¶](https://www.cug.edu.cn/) in 2019.
During this period, my research areas included computer vision, deep learning, and image/video representation learning. After graduation, I  worked on federated learning research at SenseTime by collaborating with [Weiming Zhuang](https://weiming.me/) and Shuaicheng Li. Then, I was a Research Assistant at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and collaborated with Dr. [Jie Zhang](https://cugzj.github.io/zhangjie.github.io/). If you are interested in me, please send e-mail to me. Thanks a lot!

Recently, my research interests includeÔºö
- Vision Language Model
- Federated Learning
- Computer Vision
